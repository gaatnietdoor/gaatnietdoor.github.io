For a complete picture of the migration process, see Migrate from Deep Security to Workload Security.Prerequisites Deep Security Manager 20.0.321 (20 LTS 2021-01-26) or later Check that you’re using Deep Security Agent 20.0.0-2419 or later NOTE: Virtual Appliance: Computers protected by Virtual Appliance (agent-less or combined-mode) will refuse to migrate.Migrate agents using the migration tool In upper-right corner of the Deep Security Manager console, select Support &gt; Migrate to Workload Security On the Migrate to Workload Security page that appears, select the Agents tab. Select Migrate using Computers page. The Deep Security Computers page is displayed. Select one or more computers that you want to migrate. Select Actions &gt; Migrate to Workload Security. In the dialog box that appears, specify the settings that you want applied to the agents when moved, and then select Migrate: NOTE: The proxy is optional. Leave both checkboxes selected Security Policy: If you have migrated your Deep Security policies to Workload Security and want to keep the same policy applied to the migrated agent, select Assign migrated policy. If you want to assign a different policy, choose Select a policy from Workload Security and select the new policy. Computer Group: The computer group where the agents will be put in Workload Security. Relay Group: All agents will be assigned to the Primary Relay Group in Workload Security. Proxy to contact Workload Security Manager: Select a proxy if agents need one to contact Workload Security. Proxy to contact Relay(s): Select a proxy if agents need one to contact relays on Workload Security. Migrate with existing hostname, display name, and description: Select this to use the existing hostname, display name, and description for the migrated agent. Migrate with settings override at computer level: Select this to migrate any settings that have an override at the computer level. This does not include rule assignments. Check the move status.

Gateways that are installed in your data center contact the vCenter servers on behalf of Workload Security, as seen in the diagram below.Data center gateways and Workload Security authenticate each other and communicate via encrypted channels (TLS/443).Each data center gateway maintains a list of addresses for its accessible vCenter servers. While Workload Security intends to synchronize virtual machine data with a vCenter server, a connected data center gateway bridges the request from Workload Security to the designated vCenter server.For layered protection, deploy a firewall around a data center gateway to limit its destination.Configure a data center gateway Data center gateways are supported on the following platforms: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Ubuntu 18.04 Ubuntu 20.04 " } ]
